# Before introduction of our project, there are some explanation we would like to tell the markers. 
As we started the project, the advisor recommanded us to use Jupyter notebook for developing and analysing so we didn't use Git to interact with each other. 
As a result, the project commit time in Github is different from the actual code writing time of each iteration.

1. Functional requirements: 
- Implement 5 machine learning methods - SVM, K-NN, Neural Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest to build models for predicting "redshif" in the field of astronomy. 
- Use MAE, RMSE, Accuray as evaluation metrics to compare the correctness of each method.
- Visualize predictions - original values for each method.
2. Input: Data set used to measure redshift. (The given dataset is over 25MB which is NOT able to be uploaded. The link of dataset is https://durhamuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/fvhv46_durham_ac_uk/Documents/Attachments/match_COSMOS_99_with_err(1).csv)

2. Output:
- MAE, RMSE and Accuracy scores of each machine learning method.
- Visualization of raw values and predicted values for each method. Each method has three graphs - 100% sigma variance, 68% sigma variance, outlier variance.

3. Operating environment:
- Jupyter Notebook
- python 3

4. How to run the code:
- Download dataset using link https://durhamuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/fvhv46_durham_ac_uk/Documents/Attachments/match_COSMOS_99_with_err(1).csv or we can send you the dataset by email because this link needs time to get download permission. (Without this dataset the code would not be run succesfully).
- Run "5methods_redshift.ipynb" file in Master.
