# Before introduction of our project, there are some explanation we would like to tell the markers. 
As we started the project, the advisor recommanded us to use Jupyter notebook for developing and analysing so we didn't use Git to interact with each other. 
As a result, We are sorry that the project submission log in Github records less work than what we actually completed, but the actual task amount will be specifically written in our reports and log book.


# user's handbook
1. Functional requirements: 
- Implement 5 machine learning methods - SVM, K-NN, Neural Network, Decision Tree and Random Forest to build models for predicting "redshif" in the field of astronomy. 
- Use MAE, RMSE, Accuray as evaluation metrics to compare the correctness of each method.
- Visualize predictions - original values for each method.
2. Input: Data set used to measure redshift. (As the dataset is not allowed to be shared publicly, the link for applying access is https://durhamuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/fvhv46_durham_ac_uk/Documents/Attachments/match_COSMOS_99_with_err(1).csv)

2. Output:
- MAE, RMSE and Accuracy scores of each machine learning method.
- Visualization of raw values and predicted values for each method. Each method has three graphs - 100% sigma variance, 68% sigma variance, outlier variance.

3. Operating environment:
- Jupyter Notebook
- python 3

4. How to run the code:
- Apply and download dataset  https://durhamuniversity-my.sharepoint.com/personal/fvhv46_durham_ac_uk/Documents/Attachments/match_COSMOS_99_with_err(1).csv (Since this dataset is not allowed to be shared publicly, it can only be downloaded with permission) 
- Run "5methods_redshift.ipynb" file in Master.
