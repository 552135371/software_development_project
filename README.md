# Before introduction of our project, there are some explanation we would like to tell the markers. 
As we started the project, the advisor recommanded us to use Jupyter notebook for developing and analysing so we didn't use Git to interact with each other.
At last the project commit time in Github is different from our real time (from October to January) but the log book could show our real works.

1. Our dataset file is over 25MB which is too big to be uploaded.
2. The "5methods_redshift.ipynb" contains our final results using 5 different machine learning methods to predict the redshift and visualize the output. This file needs to use Jupyter Notebook for running.
